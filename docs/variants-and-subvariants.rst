Variants and Subvariants
========================

Purpose
-------

K3Z now ships as one instance checkout with one baseline surface, a small
family of coexisting CT/fert surfaces, a full-intensive teaching family,
three PCT-only teaching subvariants, one dedicated stand-structure proving
ground, and four baseline-derived overlay subvariants.

Use this page as the canonical launch and interpretation map.

How to Choose a Surface
-----------------------

1. Start with ``base`` unless you explicitly need a treatment scaffold or an
   overlay sensitivity surface.
2. Choose ``ctfert_l15h5`` or ``ctfert_l20h0`` when the class exercise is
   about SI-specific fertilization response across the six ``L/M/H`` CT-eligible
   ``CWHvm_FDC+HW`` / ``CWHvm_CW+HW`` AUs.
   These pins now keep the AU/species/log-grade volume/value bridge hidden by
   default through ``accounts.default.csv`` only; set
   ``boolean enableLogGradeAccounts = true;`` in the pin when you explicitly
   want the full log-grade teaching surface. The canonical ``products.csv``
   track structure remains live either way.
   When enabled, the value side uses shipped coast-market teaching matrices:
   managed/treatment-driven harvest defaults to ``second_growth_coast_2025``
   and unmanaged/natural-origin harvest defaults to ``old_growth_coast_2025``.
   Species without direct report rows use explicit documented proxy mappings in
   the FEMIC recipe layer rather than silent averaging.
3. Choose one of ``intensive_light``, ``intensive_moderate``, or
   ``intensive_heavy`` when the class exercise needs the full
   ``PCT -> CT -> F1 -> F2 -> F3`` scaffold on one launchable K3Z surface.
4. Choose one of ``pct_light``, ``pct_moderate``, ``pct_heavy``, or
   ``pct_heavy_zones`` when the class exercise needs PCT intensity comparison
   without CT or fertilization. Use ``pct_heavy_zones`` specifically when the
   alternate Bianca zone-group surface is part of the teaching question.
5. Choose ``intensive_light_standstructure`` only when you are explicitly
   validating the first optional BTC stand-structure bank or extending that
   proving-ground pattern; it is not the default teaching surface for current
   student projects.
6. Choose one of the four overlay subvariants only when the exercise is about
   alternative retained-area policy on top of the accepted baseline.

Overlay Provenance and Join Contract
------------------------------------

The four overlay subvariants are **subvariants of baseline**, not separate
top-level instance variants.

Current teaching handoff:

- student source is an abandoned GIS fork, represented in the current workflow
  by an attribute-table export named ``Fragments_Retention_HSmith.xls``;
- the workbook key field is ``FEATURE_ID1`` even though the canonical K3Z join
  uses ``FEATURE_ID``;
- the four retention columns are:
  - ``Basecase_Riparian``
  - ``BaseCase_Sum``
  - ``Scenario1_Sum``
  - ``Scenario2_Sum``

Bridge used in the current workflow:

1. Student workbook row keyed by ``FEATURE_ID1``.
2. Join to ``models/k3z_patchworks_model/blocks/blocks.shp`` on
   ``FEATURE_ID``.
3. Use block identity to reach the canonical fragments surface.
4. Write a normalized overlay table keyed to the canonical fragments.
5. Rebuild one fragments surface per selected retention column.

Operationally, the overlay subvariants should differ from baseline only by
fragment-level ``RETENTION`` values and the resulting managed-vs-unmanaged area
split.

Overlay Account-Surface Note
----------------------------

High-retention overlays can legitimately drop some species-wise managed
accounts.

That is not automatically a compile failure. If retained area removes a species
from the managed side of a subvariant, the corresponding managed species
account can disappear from that subvariant's compiled tracks and live Patchworks
account view.

For the repeatable student/operator workflow, use
:doc:`overlay-subvariants-workflow`.

Log-Grade Teaching Bridge Note
------------------------------

The AU/species/log-grade volume and value families should be interpreted as a
deliberate bridge between two teaching surfaces:

- ecosystem-side harvested volume from the growth model; and
- products-side grade/value accounting for forest-sector exploration.

They are not a claim that FEMIC directly observed species-by-grade outturn in
primary BTC output. Instead, FEMIC:

1. takes the additive explicit BTC grade family ``D/F/H/I/J/U/X/Y``;
2. normalizes it so grade totals match harvested-volume totals;
3. combines those totals with AU/species volume shares; and
4. applies shipped coast-market price matrices plus documented species proxies
   to emit value accounts.

That is a modeled teaching surface, but it is intentionally auditable and
user-tweakable through the FEMIC recipe/overlay contract.

`pct_heavy_zones` Revenue Rollups
---------------------------------

The ``pct_heavy_zones`` sibling variant also ships a small set of simpler
gross-revenue rollups on top of the fine-grained log-grade value surface.

These summary accounts are available even when the full log-grade teaching
surface stays off by default:

- ``product.Logs_Grade_Value_Total.managed.CW.CC``
- ``product.Logs_Grade_Value_Total.managed.FDC.CC``
- ``product.Logs_Grade_Value_Total.managed.HW.CC``
- ``product.Logs_Grade_Value_Total.managed.PLC.CC``
- ``product.Logs_Grade_Value_Total.managed.YC.CC``
- ``product.Logs_Grade_Value_Total.managed.Total.CC``

Interpretation:

- the species accounts sum all existing ``D/F/H/I/J/U/X/Y`` value rows for
  that species across the zoned ``pct_heavy_zones`` surface;
- the ``Total`` account sums all shipped species subtotal rows into one global
  gross-revenue teaching account for clearcut harvest.

These accounts are intended as the easy-entry student surface. Turn on the full
log-grade account family only when you want the AU/species/log-grade detail.

Audit Checklist
---------------

- Keep the runtime config and PIN paired exactly as listed above.
- Compare overlay subvariants against ``base`` first, not against each other.
- Confirm the overlay source table still resolves 1:1 against the canonical
  fragments surface before interpreting results.
- Treat unexpected treatment-path changes on overlay subvariants as a bug,
  because overlays are intended to modify retained area only.
